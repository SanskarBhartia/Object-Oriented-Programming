## ABOUT

This code makes an object called work_study. We then create the student, employee and account objects. We then make a pointer to get
all classes one by one through multiple inheritance. After getting all the objects we create a new class which is virtually inherited.




## Compiling

The application should compile pretty much anything.
It requires almost no memory at all and can be used on older operating systems as well!


Currently successfully tested are:

- Windows 10
- macOS Ventura Version 13.0 (22A380)


The code can be compiled with the provided makefile using the standard `make`
command. To run the code simply download and unzip the tar files via the terminal
(tar zcvf).

Run the makefile on the Linux/Mac system by typing into the terminal:

cc -o main <File Name>.cpp
g++ -c -o main <File Name>.cpp
g++ <File Name>.cpp -o <File Name>
./main
