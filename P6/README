## Introduction

In this homework project, we created an algorithm that plays wordle against a server. We
based this algorithm off of hw1, in which we player computer v computer wordle, and took it
a level up by getting servers involved

## Compiling

Compiles through makefile using command make

The application should compile pretty much anything.
It requires almost no memory at all and can be used on older operating systems as well!


Currently successfully tested are:

- Windows 10
- macOS Ventura Version 13.0 (22A380)

First, make the file. After, you would open a terminal and the algorithm should run by itself


## How it works

We took inspiration from hw1, implementing the algorithm from that program. The key is to find the word
as efficiently as possible. To achieve this, we eliminate words from the file of words that have letters that are
not a part of the answer, and keep trying words with different letters till the answer is obtained

## Result

Everytime we get a guess wrong, it reflects on our score as a -4, but every guess that is right gives us +100, and
this change in score is reflected on the server.
